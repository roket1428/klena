impressions experiences search impressions people search memory within memory one experience offered instead specific memory person reject experience find looking recollection occurs one retrieved

sensing recalling remembering function wakefulness since person sense sleep desire result sensation however senses able work sleep albeit differently unless weary dreams involve actually sensing stimulus dreams sensation still involved altered manner aristotle explains person stares moving stimulus waves body water looks away next thing look appears wavelike motion person perceives stimulus stimulus longer focus attention leaves impression body awake senses functioning properly person constantly encounters new stimuli sense impressions previously perceived stimuli ignored however sleep impressions made throughout day noticed new distracting sensory experiences dreams result lasting impressions since impressions left exact stimuli dreams resemble actual waking experience sleep person altered state mind aristotle compares sleeping person person overtaken strong feelings toward stimulus example person strong infatuation someone may begin think see person everywhere overtaken

foretelling sent divine aristotle reasoned instances dreams resemble future events simply coincidences aristotle claimed dream first established fact person asleep experience person image appear
